# HousePricePredictionProject

#First I deal with the missing data
#After, I do some data visualization and exploration, and find which variables are most correlated which I want to use on my model
#I also find outliers which I take out of my data
#I then do multiple linear regression, with a train test split and k-fold validation, and do some plotting to show the accuracy of my model
#backwards elimination
#I also look at my test data to do some predictions
